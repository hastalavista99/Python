# python lists use square brackets '[]'  and indexed from 0
# Python doesnt have built in processes for arrays, lists are used due to the similar patterns and design
# the len() function is used to get the length of lists and other data in python
# the sorted() function sorts the elements of a list
# as per python documentation, sorted(iterable, key=None, reverse=False)
